
# User Registration and Authentication API

This project is a fullstack application built with **Express.js**, **React.js**, and **MongoDB** to handle user registration, login, and authentication. It provides secure authentication with JWT and cookie-based sessions. This API also includes endpoints to manage user data and preferences.

## üöÄ Running the Project Locally

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** and **npm** installed on your machine.

To run the project on your local machine, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the repository:

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/shivasaineelam/finacplus-full-stack-shivasaineelam.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project folder:

After cloning, navigate into the project directory:
```bash
cd backend
```

### 3. Set up environment variables:

Create a `.env` file in the backend folder of the project and include the following:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB_CONNECTION_URL=mongodb+srv://shivasai:shivasai@cluster0.8039zjo.mongodb.net/finacplus-fullstack
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173/
environment=dev
```

Make sure to replace the MongoDB connection URL with your own if needed.

### 4. Install the required dependencies:

Once your environment variables are in place, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

### 5. Start the server:

Now that everything is set up, you can start the server by running:
```bash
npm start
```

The server will start running at `http://localhost:5000`.
